Your friend Dario examined your body and discovered that you have a cybernetic heart, it seems like that weird dream was not a dream at all...

After that revelation, you think that maybe someone wants or maybe needs an organic heart and instead of buying it in a legal way which its really expensive in this times, had prefered to stole it from of a poor guy... that poor guy will be fighting a losing battle to claim it

Since then, you will investigate all the weird movements and accidents of the city waiting to find some clue or something that helps to find it.
