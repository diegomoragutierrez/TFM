At the superior part of the game you will see a bar like this. This is divided into three parts:

Life: Number of hits your ship could recieve so you must kept it below 0 during all the level. 
If you are hitted you will lose a life.

Time: This time will be decremented, so you must end the current level before the time goes 0.

Credits: You must end the current level with a value greather than 0, if you destroy enemies you will lose credits, so try to avoid enemies and their lasers instead of destroy them.

You can destroy lasers and garbage without penalty.
Expansive Wave can only destroy lasers and garbage.
Neutralizer Ray can only neutralize enemy ships.
